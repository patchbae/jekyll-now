## Set Gmail as Your Defaut Email Client for Mailto Links

This solves the problem of having Outlook, Mail, or another default email client opening mailto links.

If you haven't set Gmail up to do this yet, clicking on the link below will open your computer's default email client:
[contact me](mailto:anonymous@gmail.com)

Here's how to set it up to work with Gmail instead:

1. Open Gmail in Chrome and click on the overlapping diamond symbol in the address bar. It's to the left of the bookmark star). <br>

2. Select "Allow" when prompted to "Allow mail.google.com to open all email links?"

That's it! Never copy paste an email link again!
