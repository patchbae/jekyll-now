title: How to Set Gmail as Your Defaul Email Client for Mailto Links
---

This solves the problem of having Outlook, Mail, or another default email client opening mailto links.

If you haven't set Gmail as your default, clicking on the following link will open your computer's default email client:
[contact me](mailto:anonymous@gmail.com)

1. Open Gmail in Chrome and click on the overlapping diamond symbol in the address bar (to the left of the bookmark star).
2. Select "Allow" when prompted to "Allow mail.google.com to open all email links?"

Never copy paste an email link again!
