For this assignment, Camilla and I had initially thought about filming someone skateboarding while wearing a green screen suit and using that footage as a frame to animate within. We scratched that idea due to some logistical issues, but decided to continue with the theme of skateboarding. Camilla then asked me if there were any animals that I resonated with and I told her, the sloth! I actually used to have a mural of a colorful sloth hanging out in my old bedroom (see below):

Camilla then came up with our main character, Sloth Kong, and drew him in photoshop and exported him as layers!

We initially played with the idea of animating the kick and push of skating, but decided to stick to letting Sloth Kong coast around and do a few tricks here and there. The story is simply about a hungry, skateboarding sloth's mission to get a slice of pizze before going to skate some more. It is set to the song "The New", by J Dilla, with sound effects taken from Gojira's (Godzilla) Theme Song.

And here's the video!
