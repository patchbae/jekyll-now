For this assignment, Camilla and I had initially thought about filming someone skateboarding while wearing a green screen suit and using that footage as a frame to animate within. We scratched that idea due to some logistical issues, but decided to continue with the theme of skateboarding. Camilla then asked me if there were any animals that I resonated with and I told her, the sloth! I actually used to have a mural of a colorful sloth hanging out in my old bedroom (see below):

Camilla then came up with our main character, Sloth Kong, and drew him in photoshop and exported him as layers!

We initially played with the idea of animating the kick and push of skating, but decided to stick to letting Sloth Kong coast around and do a few tricks here and there. We divided the tasks between us, splitting the animation work about evenly, while Camilla did the cover art and character design, while I did the sound design. Below are the four backgrounds that I used, with minimal editing done in Photoshop to take advantage of usings layers for masking:

## Brooklyn Bridge

Here I cut the boat out to a new layer and added a simple animated wave over the water to give it some more motion.

## Best Pizza

This is a pizza place near my friend's house in Williamsburg where I used to get pizza all the time. Really good white slice. Here's the pizza clip art I used:

The story is simply about a hungry, skateboarding sloth's mission to get a slice of pizze before going to skate some more. It is set to the song "The New", by J Dilla, with sound effects taken from Gojira's (Godzilla) Theme Song.

And here's the video!
