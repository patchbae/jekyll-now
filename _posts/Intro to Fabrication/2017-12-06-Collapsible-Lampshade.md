For this assignment, I wanted to use soft materials and try sewing something by hand. I decided to make a hanging lampshapde that was collapsible so it could travel easily. For materials, I used some wire, white lycra, a clotheshanger, and a standard light socket.

I started by making a simple ring using the wire. Since the gauge was relatively thing, I wrapped a piece of wire around itself to provide additional support.

Once the ring was made, I cut the top of the hangar off and attached it to the ring using small pieces of wire.

I then sewed the lycra fabric to the ring and then sewed the gap closed.

And lastly the light socket was wrapped around the top of the hangar and dropped into the shade.
