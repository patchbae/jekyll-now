I've been trying to use as many recycled or scrap parts in my projects and before we met last week, I had salvaged two pieces of plywood and a piece of aluminum tubing from the junk shelf. I had wanted to practice on the bandsaw and scroll saw, so I used the bandsaw to cut the plywood into two discs. Then I drilled a starter hole in the center of each disc and used the scroll saw to cut a circle that the aluminum tubing could fit in.
