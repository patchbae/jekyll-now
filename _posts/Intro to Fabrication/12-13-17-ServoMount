For this final assigment, I decided to improve the servo mount for my PCOMP project, the Expressfier. The concept of this project involves using an expression pedal to control a servo motor

I started by making a simple ring using the wire. Since the gauge was relatively thing, I wrapped a piece of wire around itself to provide additional support.

Once the ring was made, I cut the top of the hangar off and attached it to the ring using small pieces of wire.

I then sewed the lycra fabric to the ring and then sewed the gap closed.

And lastly the light socket was wrapped around the top of the hangar and dropped into the shade.
