The format for this assignment was to create six square compositions that utilized the same color palette and to post it on Instagram. I went with a 6-tone color palette, using red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow. The color were arranged in the order they would appear on a wraparound spectrum, and the six compositions were designed to be viewed together in a 3x2 grid. Here are the six images below:
