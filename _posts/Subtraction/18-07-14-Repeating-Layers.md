For our 2.5D assignment, I went about making a stack of nested shapes inside of circles. I decided alternate back and forth between circles and squares. I started with very thing pieces of ply that I cut to shape to fit into the mill.

For every layer, I started with the inner cut and then did the outer cut. I started with the largest piece, a circle with a smaller circle cut out of it.

I then cut a another layer, and fit the square inside the previous layer's circle.

I repeated this until I had seven layers.

And here is the final shape:
