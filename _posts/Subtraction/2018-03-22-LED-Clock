For our CNC midterm, I decided to make an LED clock using a NeoPixel strip. The NeoPixel LEDs come at 60 pixels per meter, so that was really convenient. I started with a piece of 1" ply.

I used a shape copy to make 60 circles following the path of a circle.

I also routed a pocket in the center for the Arduino to sit in.

My initial cut had 61 pockets instead of 60, so I had to re-do that.
