If I learned anything from the first week's assignment it was that freehanding a router is very difficult, and therefore jigs are super important! I started by drilling holes near the four corners of a piece of plywood. Using a circle jig, I made cuts at the same lengths from each corner dowel, starting to create a symmetrical pattern

Here it is with two cuts.

 Now three.

 We're up to eight cuts now.

 And here is the final product, with a total of 16 cuts, with 4 cuts made from each corner.
