If I learned anything from the first week's assignment it was that freehanding a router is very difficult, and therefore jigs are super important! I started by drilling holes near the four corners of a piece of plywood.

Using a circle jig, I made cuts at the same lengths from each corner dowel, starting to create a symmetrical pattern

 I unfortunately did not get photos of every cut, but the idea is made apparent.
