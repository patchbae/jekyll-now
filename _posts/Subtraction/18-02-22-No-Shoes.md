I wanted to see if I could make a pictographic sign indicating not to wear shoes past this point. I imported an image of a crossed-out shoe and framed it in a octagon to mimic a stop sign. I started with a piece of plywood that I'd bought a while ago, unfortunately it was slightly warped.

I used three pockets and one contour cut. When running the animation, I noticed this red line but I assumed that was just the path of the bit not cutting. I am now certain that was indicating an error in my toolpath or settings, since it actually made that cut.

You can see see two cuts across the design that weren't inteneded to be there.

I ended up just grabbing a chisel to chip away at the layers that had been accidentally cut.

After a bit of sanding, I got it to look like this.

I'm assuming those errant cuts were due to me not setting enough clearance or setting a toolpath that was invalid.
