For the Kinetic to Light assignment, our group wanted to create a mechanism that would be playful while also allowing for participation from mulitple users. Naturally, we gravitated towards all the playground acitivites. We thought about using swings, but realized the challenge in converting motion in two directions into a stable source of electricity. The next thought was to get a lazy susan to create a scaled-down version of a carousel, but this would involved belt drives and building housing for both the motor and "fly wheel" assembly. We also realized we would probably need to get a lower RPM motor than the one we had already sourced. So finally, we decided to try and create electricity using jump rope. 

The initial design will include a single motor in the handle of the jump rope, with the rope attached to the shaft of the motor. If possible, we would like to use EL wire or LED strands as the jump rope itself. Updates to this post will be added here after the next class meeting.
