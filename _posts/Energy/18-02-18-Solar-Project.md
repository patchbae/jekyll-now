For our solar project, Sam and I wanted to make a solar-powered device to help look after plants. The concept is straightforward, to use solar energy to slowly rotate a plant and monitor its hydration level. Instead of trying to store large amounts of energy, we will simply store up enough energy to make a slight rotation and to make a measurment of the water level. Our idea for monitoring the water level would be similar to a gas gauge in a car, with a servo rotating according the plant's hydration. This way, even when the device is not being powered, it can still display the plant's hydration. 

Both the rotation and the water level readings will be done in regular intervals, with the measurements for the water level made less frequently. We have currently ordered the parts we need and will begin testing later this week.
