 -title: Color Mixing Lamp
---

I've been working as a lighting designer for the past few years, primarily in the context of live music events. But before that experience, I had never really interacted with RGB or CMY color spaces, much less had an understanding of these additive and subtractive models of color. 

So, I decided to make a color mixing lamp using an RGB LED strip that communicates with a p5.js sketch to help visualize the color mixing process. Here is the p5 sketch that is stripped down to just run in the browser:

And here is a link to a quick [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=5olEyy52bp8)!

I am working on the schematic since it may change after getting feedback during this week's class.
