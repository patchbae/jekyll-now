 -title: What is Interaction?
---

We can look at interaction as an exchange between two entities, wherein a transfer of information affects change in both parties. These transfers of information need to be informed by one another and must happen at speed, else the feeling of interaction is lost and the exchange becomes one sided. My personal experience with interactivity revolves largely around the idea of spontaneous creation in music, in that by creating a circumstance that allows for this kind of mutual exchange ("interaction"), unique experiences will unfold as the musicians' ideas warp and reflect upon one another, manifesting in new ways.
