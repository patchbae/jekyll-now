 -title: Tinny Trumpet
---

My main instrument has always been bass, but I've always wanted to play trumpet. I once managed to get my hands on a trumpet for a few months, much to my roomates' dismay, but I have a trumpet no more. So I hacked one together using some buttons, aluminum cans, a small omni microphone, and our trusty Arduino. 

Instead of going with standard trumpet figuring, I devised my own six-button scheme: 4 note-buttons and 2 octave-buttons. The first three note-buttons act very much like a binary counter, giving you access to the 7 diatonic notes of a major scale. The fourth note-button sharpens whatever note is currently being played, so you have access to the full chromatic scale. 

The initial model did not incorporate breath control, and the note simply sounded as soon as it was pressed. Here is a video of it on the breadboard:
