I had this idea when I was still in my undergraduate program studying Music Technology, but I never actually tried to prototype or build it, so I figured now was a good as time as any to start on it. The initial concept was to take a generic expression pedal and create an interface that would allow for it to control multiple servo motors wirelessly. The servo motors would be housed in such a way as to allow connection to the knobs of a guitar pedal, while simultaneously drawing power from a generic 9V power supply. The units will communicate over an XBEE wireless system. The main transmitter unit will house an Arduino, while the receiver units will ideally just use an XBEE module. For this class, my aim is to get the controller unit and a single servo and housing working.
