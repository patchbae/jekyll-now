 -title: Color Mixing Guide

I've been working as a lighting designer for the past few years, primarily in the context of live music events. But before that experience, I had never really interacted with RGB or CMY color spaces, much less had an intuitive understanding of these additive and subtractive models. 

So, I decided to make a color mixing lamp using an RGB LED strip that also communicates with a p5.js sketch to help visualize the color mixing process. 



The initial model did not incorporate breath control, and the note simply sounded as soon as it was pressed. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZwOD4DRv5s&feature=youtu.be) of it on the breadboard:

I decided to try and add some breath control, but this proved to be more difficult than I expected. I used some of the Arduino sample code to collect an average value for the microphone, and then based my readings off of that. The main issue I was experiencing was that the valuse seemed to wrap around back to zero (I'm assuming since the microphone creates an AC signal, the readings were centered around zero). I managed to get a fairly decent signal, but since I did not use an op amp to amplify the microphone, you need to blow fairly hard. All in all, I got a decenly working prototype done using minimal components. Here is the final circuit diagram and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM0aXAJYJiQ&feature=youtu.be) demo of the instrument:
