 -title: Subway Turnstile

I was having a hard time picking what piece of technology to survey for this project, so I thought about technologies that I interact with most often. I realized there was one piece of equipment that, not only did I interact with almost daily, but also have observed countless other's interactions with it: the MTA metrocard scanner and turnstile. 

The turnstile acts as a measure to ensure riders pay their fare for riding the subway, in addition to being used to count the amount of users. There are two types of turnstiles in use as far as I have observed: the horizontal turnstile and the vertical turnstile.
