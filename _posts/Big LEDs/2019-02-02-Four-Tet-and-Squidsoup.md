Four Tet collaborated with lighting team, Squidsoup, to create a simple, yet immersive lighting rig for his tour in 2015-2016. Squidsoup used around 5000-6000 addressedable RGB festoon LEDs. Each strand had about 24 LEDs and was hung from a single point so it fell verticaly. The strands were arranged in a grid of 24 across and 8 deep, creating a volumetric sculpture of light behind the artist on stage. In smaller venues, the sculpture would almost completely engulf a large part of the room. While possible to control it using traditional 2D media, all of the content was controlled in real-time using custom software, to be fully able to take advantage of the multiple layers of lights. 

I really admire this project because of its minimal design that still allows for a multitude of possibilities within its confines. It almost forces a re-imaging of how to create and perform visual content that can unfold through multiple layers as opposed to just working with a 2-dimensional image on a screen. I imagine it must have also been easy to tour with, as it doesn't require much power and would be relatively easy to install from venue to venue.
