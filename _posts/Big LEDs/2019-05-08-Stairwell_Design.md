"Create an LED installation for a stairwell that enters down into an event. The ‘visual priority’ is the entrance down the stairs, not the exit up the stairs."

For this installation design, I wanted to use a series of LED arches to create the appearane of a tunnel going down from the street-level entrance into the event.
