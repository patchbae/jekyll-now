"Create an LED installation for a stairwell that enters down into an event. The ‘visual priority’ is the entrance down the stairs, not the exit up the stairs."

For this installation design, I wanted to use a series of LED archways to create the appearance of a tunnel going down from the street-level entrance into the event. 

A total of eight (8) archways would be used. Each archway has an arc length of 9' and will have 180 RGB pixels. 
Custom channel strips will be constructed out of aluminum, with the LEDs on the bottom of the archway. Diffusion will be used.
