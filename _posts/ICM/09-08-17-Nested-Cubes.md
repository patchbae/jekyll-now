I initially decided to make a series of nested cubes, using a 3-color palette. I figured I would go about this by drawing three quads to make a cube, and performing displacements after that. Let's start with figuring out how to draw a cube and center it on the screen...

This yielded a pretty decent result considered the math was guesstimated. I definitely went with a trial and error approach until this result was achieved.
