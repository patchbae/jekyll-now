I initially decided to make a series of nested cubes, using a 3-color palette. I figured I would go about this by drawing three quads to make a cube, encapsulating the cube code into a function, and then performing displacements after that. Let's start with figuring out how to draw a cube and center it on the screen...

This yielded a pretty decent result considering the math was guesstimated. I definitely went with a trial and error approach until this result was achieved. I'm not entirely sure why PI is in there... but it kinda worked? The next step was to try and make some more cubes using "translate".
