#### [Chicken Game](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/blairsimmons/sketches/ByJQ7Tpc-)
Blair and I decided to work on her chicken game, but we only had the opportunity to meet very briefly, but we sent each other code to look at. I added a single function to the code and made slight modifications elsewhere so that the score only increased when the egg falls into the nest. The speed now also increases whenever you score.  Blair added a really cool easter egg, that's all I'll reveal. My high score was 14.

#### [RGB Slider](https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/patchbae/sketches/HJ1Y53f3W)
After managing to get my fader function working last week with arrays, I decided to make my own RGB fader. The faders control the background color. Blair added the section that gives the numerical readouts for the individual RGB values.

I was looking at one of Daniel Shiffman's recursive examples and started playing around with making an animation. This was the result:
