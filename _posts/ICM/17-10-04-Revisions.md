#### [Chicken Game](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/blairsimmons/sketches/ByJQ7Tpc-)
To be quite honest, I didn't have as much time to work on this as I would've liked. Blair and I decided to work on her chicken game, but we only had the opportunity to meet very briefly. I added a single function to the code and made slight modifications elsewhere so that the score only increased when the egg falls into the nest. The speed now also increases whenever you score. My high score was 14.

After managing to get my fader function working last week with arrays, I decided to make my own RGB fader. The faders control the background color. Blair added the section that gives the numerical readouts for the individual RGB values.
