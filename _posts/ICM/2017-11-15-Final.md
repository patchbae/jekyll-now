### Concept
My idea for my final project is to see if I can create a system that allows for someone's mobile devices to become a pixel in a light show. The idea is currently intended only for implementation in a seated venue, as it would ask the user to input their seat row and number in order to determine which pixel the phone should represent. The main challenge that I see myself facing is figuring out how to allow multiple phones to access the same pixel information and controlling for latency.

### Updates
This week I began getting node.js under my belt just by following Shiffman's tutorials. So far I got a localhost server running on my computer and managed to get an older p5.js sketch running.
