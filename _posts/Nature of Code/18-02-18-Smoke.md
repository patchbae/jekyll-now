I'd already been working with types of particle systems in a number of my previous exercises, so I decided to re-work a previous sketch to more resemble smoke. I started with this fall and rising sketch using 4 points to create animated quads

I first changed the quads to bezier curves to get more natural shapes. I also narrowed the possible ranges of displacement in the x-axis to get a taller, pointier shape. I also set the color to a static white and had the opacity start at a lower value. This greatly helped the look of the smoke. I also added a timer so that it constatnly repopulates the amount of smoke. Here was the result:
