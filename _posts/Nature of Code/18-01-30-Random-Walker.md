I started by manipulating the Perlin noise walker so that the colors varied within a certain range.

I was inspired by the Max/MSP object called "drunk", which causes a change in value within a certain range (i.e. the value will either be decreased or increased by a value between x and y). I am applying this drunken step separately to the red, green, and blue values. 

I then moved onto to create a multitude of objects, switching out the ellipses for lines. What I did initially to create the second coordinate, was simply to inverse
