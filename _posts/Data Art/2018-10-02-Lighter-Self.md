Initially for this project, I had wanted to collect data every hour for a week about what I was doing / what was on my mind. However, I found that my observations of my behavior were in fact influencing how I was acting. I was also not disciplined enough to collect enough hourly data to create a meaningful peace. 

So instead I decided to look at a lightshow I programmed for Robotaki's current tour, go cue by cue for some songs, and use color information to create self portraits. We had 14 fixtures, each with ten pixels. The song unfolds in the horizontal direction, each cue given equal space in the image regardless of how long the cue actually lasted in the song. The vertical domain is subdivided so that each light pixel is given equal spacing.
