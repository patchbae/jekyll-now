So to be perfectly honest, I struggled a bit longer than I should have just parsing the data at first, haha. I needed a bit of a refresher on object arrays. But once I figured that out, it was really fun to try and figure out ways to visualize it. I started with just a simple, bar graph style chart. My biggest diffiulty was working with scale (as some values were extremely small compared to the maximum). I added color for the regions and a readout based on mouse position.
