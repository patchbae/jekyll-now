Face:Face is a conceptual data capture and visualization piece utilizing WebSockets and Node.JS in the browser. It is designed to show the whole process of data visualization: starting with gathering data, processing the data, and finalizing visualizing it. It is also made to highlight connections and similarities between people who are gathered together in a space or at an event. This system is designed to be easy to setup and run, only requiring good phone service/Wi-Fi, the ability to dim the lighting in the space, a PA system to announce the questions, and a computer to run the server. For my final, I worked with Sam Chasan to try and realize this piece on a small scale.

The operator will give instructions to the participants, telling them to use their laptops or phones to access a website. That will be a series of yes or no questions, each with a slider to choose a color that you associate with the question (there are 8 color options). Our server will collect the data and associate it with each device's unique client ID. Once the quiz is completed, the website will blackout and wait for the operator to begin playback. Once everyone has finished the quiz, the piece will begin.

Each question will be announced and if a user has answered yes to that question, their phone's display will light up, illuminating just their face in the darkness with the color they chose. This is intended to highlight the similarities between people and two show connections that would otherwise go unnoticed. After that, the operator will trigger another event, and everyone's devices will light up showing which color they chose. That way, even people who answered "no" to a question, can still feel involved with the piece. 

The questions would ideally be tailored to the specific crowd of the event / space, but a more generic quiz could be created to suit a broad range of audiences. By having the questions progress from more specific to more general, the piece would unfold from just small sections of the crowd being lit to having the whole audience illuminated by the end. 

The questions could range from serious and philosophical to the silly and mundane, but would ideally provide a mix of questions so that everyone in the room will be involved.
