My idea for this midterm is to create a website that will play a soundfile once every second, synchronously across multiple devices to create a common pulse. I would like to leverage the device's own system clock for this, allowing the pulse to be driven by that. Once the total number of users have joined the page, the piece will begin. I will experiment with latency and clock drift, to see if this will have an impact on the performance. 

If I can manage to get that working well, I will add a visual element to the piece that also pulses. After a minute or two of sync, some of the devices will begin to play different sub-divisions of the pulse to create varied rhythms. This will devolve into something more chaotic and random, but will eventually sync once again to the inital common pulse.
